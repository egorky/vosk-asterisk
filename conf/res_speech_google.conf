; service_account_key_path = /path/to/your/service_account_key.json
; Optional: Path to the Google Cloud service account key JSON file.
; If commented out or not set, the module will attempt to use Application Default Credentials (ADC).
; ADC are typically configured by setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
; or by running `gcloud auth application-default login`.
; How to obtain a service account key:
; 1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com).
; 2. Navigate to "IAM & Admin" -> "Service Accounts".
; 3. Select your project.
; 4. Click "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT".
; 5. Fill in the service account details.
; 6. Grant the "Cloud Speech-to-Text API User" role (or a role with equivalent permissions) to the service account.
; 7. Click "DONE".
; 8. Find the created service account in the list, click on the three dots under "Actions", and select "Manage keys".
; 9. Click "ADD KEY" -> "Create new key".
; 10. Choose "JSON" as the key type and click "CREATE". The JSON key file will be downloaded.
; 11. Securely store this file and provide its path here if you choose to use key-based authentication.
